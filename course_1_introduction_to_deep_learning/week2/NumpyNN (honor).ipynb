    "### Peer-reviewed assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Congradulations, you managed to get this far! There is just one quest left undone, and this time you'll get to choose what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option I: initialization\n",
    "* Implement Dense layer with Xavier initialization as explained [here](http://bit.ly/2vTlmaJ)\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass this assignment, you must conduct an experiment showing how xavier initialization compares to default initialization on deep networks (5+ layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option II: regularization\n",
    "* Implement a version of Dense layer with L2 regularization penalty: when updating Dense Layer weights, adjust gradients to minimize\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Loss = Crossentropy + \\alpha \\cdot \\underset i \\sum {w_i}^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass this assignment, you must conduct an experiment showing if regularization mitigates overfitting in case of abundantly large number of neurons. Consider tuning $\\alpha$ for better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option III: optimization\n",
    "* Implement a version of Dense layer that uses momentum/rmsprop or whatever method worked best for you last time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of those methods require persistent parameters like momentum direction or moving average grad norm, but you can easily store those params inside your layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass this assignment, you must conduct an experiment showing how your chosen method performs compared to vanilla SGD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General remarks\n",
    "_Please read the peer-review guidelines before starting this part of the assignment._\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a good solution is one that:\n",
    "* is based on this notebook\n",
